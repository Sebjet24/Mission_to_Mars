# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, I’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Summary

The end result was a completely functioning web application built using Flask that includes photos, a table comparing Mars to Earth, and the most recent article title and short description scraped from NASA's homepage. When we click the "Scrape Fresh Data" button, both the webpage and the MongoDB are updated with new information.
